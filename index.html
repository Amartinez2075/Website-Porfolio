    <h3>
      Greetings, my name is Ashara Martinez, and I am a full-stack developer in training. 
      I am currently enrolled in an online full-stack development course offered by Washington University. 
      I am currently progressing through the second stage of the program, and I anticipate completing the course by the end of June 2023.
      As a dedicated learner, I am passionate about honing my skills and gaining practical experience to contribute positively to the tech industry.

    <h2>Coding Experience</h2>
   <img src="Screenshots\Coding Image.jpg" alt="Code" width="800" height="400">
    <p> As a coding bootcamp student, I have gained valuable experience in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and other related applications. Throughout my coursework, I have worked on a variety of projects, ranging from simple code generators to more complex applications like a product designed to locate local breweries and pubs. I am dedicated to continually expanding my skills and knowledge to deliver high-quality work to my clients or potential employers.

      In addition to the technical skills I have gained, I have also developed essential soft skills such as teamwork, communication, and problem-solving. These skills have proven invaluable in completing projects within a team setting and communicating effectively with clients or stakeholders.
      
      My experience in coding bootcamp has also led me to pursue various extracurricular activities to supplement my learning. For example, I frequently attend coding meetups, online forums, and hackathons to network with other developers and learn about new trends and techniques. Furthermore, I have also contributed to open-source projects, which has allowed me to work collaboratively with other developers while honing my skills.
      
      One of my most significant achievements thus far has been the development of a web application for a local restaurant. The application featured an easy-to-use ordering system and integrated payment gateway. I designed and implemented the user interface, backend system, and database management, which resulted in a seamless ordering process for customers and streamlined operations for the restaurant. The restaurant owner was impressed with the final product and has seen a significant increase in online orders since its implementation.
      
      As a programmer, I recognize the importance of continuous learning and staying up-to-date with the latest technological advancements. In pursuit of this, I am currently studying Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, which I believe will be crucial in developing innovative and cutting-edge solutions for my clients. Additionally, I am also exploring the world of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, which I believe will be instrumental in transforming the way we conduct transactions.
      
      In conclusion, my experience in coding bootcamp has equipped me with the technical and soft skills necessary to excel as a programmer. I am passionate about programming and committed to continually expanding my knowledge and expertise to deliver exceptional results to my clients or potential employers.

    <h2>Blog</h2>
    <p>To begin, I would like to elucidate the reasons that initially sparked my interest in pursuing a career in programming. At a fundamental level, the field of programming represents a burgeoning industry that will undoubtedly continue to necessitate the skill set of proficient developers, be it in languages such as JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and beyond. Additionally, I possess a firm grasp on the technical intricacies of computers, particularly as it pertains to hardware components. For example, I possess knowledge regarding the hardware components that may cause bottlenecks, which RAM is compatible with particular motherboards, and other related areas of expertise.

In recent years, my perception of programming has evolved, and I now regard it as a means of obtaining financial freedom. Living in my current location has left me feeling trapped in a state of stagnation, and the prospect of eventual decay and collapse looms ominously. Circumstances outside of my control have exacerbated these concerns, further fueling my desire to pursue a career in programming. The realization of my aspiration was galvanized by a conversation with a friend, whose sibling had successfully completed a coding boot camp, subsequently securing a well-paying job, and ultimately relocating from their hometown.

I must concede that the path to achieving my goals was challenging. At the time, I was employed as a dishwasher at Washington University, working long hours from 4 pm to midnight. My energy was gradually depleted, with little time to unwind, and colleagues who, at best, were unhelpful and, at worst, obstructive. Although my boyfriend was working at the same establishment, and his support was invaluable, my job became increasingly arduous. In addition, I suffered a tailbone injury that left me in constant pain, and the burden of performing the work of four individuals while my colleagues shirked their responsibilities weighed heavily upon me. Nonetheless, I eventually secured employment elsewhere, albeit at a lower salary. Nevertheless, I remain determined to attain a programming position that will enable me to relocate to Canada, where I hope to create a new life with my boyfriend and escape the stagnation and decay that pervades my current environment.
