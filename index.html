      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p> Hi my name is Ashara Martinez and I'm currently a novice web developer attending the 6 month online full stack coding class from Washington University.
        Before I started the coding program I was struggling with finding a stable job, covid made it really hard to find stable work and I wanted a way to support myself 
        and my boyfriend. I always had an affinity with technology, more so on the hardware side instead of the coding side, but I thought it would be a good idea to get into this program
        in the hopes that I can learn a new skill, get a new job, and hopefully move out of the country within 2-3 years. </p>

      <p>Currently I'm at about 2 months into my full stack coding class course. I have gotten most of my coding experience from their but I got all of my experience regarding computer
        hardware in my own time. In 2020 I built my first computer that was primarily used for gaming and video editing. That same year I built my little brothers 2 computers and my boyfriend a computer
        for streaming and making artwork. And in 2021 I built myself a upgraded computer with a new case, and new parts.
